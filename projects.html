    <h2>Hangman Game Project</h2>
    <p>
        As part of **CSI 2300: Software Development**, I teamed up with partners to create a **Hangman game with a graphical user interface (GUI)** using **Java** and **JavaFX**.  
        Our goal was to make the game interactive and user-friendly, and we implemented several features to enhance the experience:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple **difficulty levels** (easy, medium, hard) to challenge players of different skill levels.</li>
        <li>Various **categories** of words, including movies, animals, and technology, so the game stays fun and varied.</li>
        <li>**Hint system** to help players when they get stuck, adding a strategic element.</li>
        <li>Clean, intuitive **GUI design** with buttons, text fields, and visual feedback for correct/incorrect guesses.</li>
        <li>Collaborative workflow using GitHub to **manage code, track changes, and merge contributions** from each team member.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This project taught me a lot about **team communication**, **problem-solving**, and designing software that balances functionality and user experience.  
        I focused on implementing the **GUI and hint system**, while coordinating with teammates on game logic and category setup.
